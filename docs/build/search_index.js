Over time, a client may receive several services – typically compensation payments – which are tallied up administratively as part of the client's claim. Some services are granted without much scrutiny, whereas some service requests involve a deliberation between the insurer and the client. In some cases, external parties such as lawyers or medical professionals may be engaged in these deliberations.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Overview","title":"Overview","text":"These dynamics are represented in the GENSIMO framework as a succession of client states interspersed by deliberative processes, where each successive state is the outcome of such a process. This leads to a picture like in Figure 1. With an appropriate notion of 'state', the client-scheme dynamics can then be formalised as a Markov Decision Process (MDP, see e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process). An MDP has a state space and an action space – containing all possible states and actions, respectively. The actions in GENSIMO correspond to models of a deliberative process and, in principle, a completely different model can be used for each action.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Overview","title":"Overview","text":"(Image: client pathways) Figure 1.

Typically MDPs are used to find some form of optimal policy, for example, using Dynamic Programming or Reinforcement Learning algorithms. Though this could be done in the GENSIMO framework, it is not the default approach. Rather, the policy represents the settings of the scheme – that is, the settings of the modelled version of the scheme.","category":"page"}]
